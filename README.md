Serenus - Mental Wellness Web Application
Serenus is a serene, interactive mental wellness application designed to help users manage their emotional health through journaling, mood tracking, and guided breathing exercises. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a beautiful sakura-themed interface and AI-powered insights using Google's Gemini API.

About the Name
The name "Serenus" is derived from the Latin word meaning calm, peaceful, and serene. This name perfectly captures the essence of our application, which is designed to be a sanctuary for users seeking peace and tranquility in their daily lives. Just as the word suggests, Serenus aims to provide a calm and collected space where users can process their emotions and find inner peace.

Design Philosophy
The visual and audio design of Serenus was carefully curated to create an atmosphere of tranquility and wellness. We chose a Japanese cherry blossom aesthetic with sakura trees as the background because cherry blossoms symbolize beauty, renewal, and the transient nature of life. This imagery encourages mindfulness and reflection, reminding users to appreciate the present moment. The soft rose and pink color palette was selected for their psychological associations with calmness, compassion, and emotional healing. These warm yet gentle tones create a comforting environment that invites users to open up and express their feelings. The background music featured on the home page is ambient and meditative in nature, specifically chosen to enhance relaxation and reduce anxiety without being intrusive or distracting.

Features
Home Page
The home page features a mood dial where users can select from four emotional states: Happy, Calm, Sad, and Anxious. Based on the selected mood, the application provides AI-powered guidance with personalized insights and coping strategies tailored to the user's emotional state. The interface includes soothing visual effects through particle animations and offers optional calming background music to enhance the experience. The design is fully responsive and works seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices.

Journal Page
The journal page provides a beautiful, distraction-free writing interface for users to document their thoughts and feelings. Each entry can be tagged with the user's emotional state through mood tracking, and all entries are automatically dated and timestamped for easy reference. Users can browse their past entries in a timeline view displayed in reverse chronological order. The application generates AI-generated reflections and guidance based on the journal content, providing personalized insights into the user's emotional patterns. Users have the ability to delete entries with confirmation, and all entries are saved securely in the browser's local storage.

Breathe Page
The breathe page offers an interactive breathing exercise with visual cues to guide users through proper breathing techniques. Users can customize the timing of each breath to their comfort level, and the interface features an animated circle that expands and contracts in synchronization with the recommended breathing pattern.

Design & Aesthetics
The application uses a serene Japanese cherry blossom aesthetic with a sakura video background throughout. The color scheme features soft, calming rose and pink tones that create a soothing atmosphere. The interface includes calm background music to enhance relaxation, and all interactions feature smooth animations with elegant transitions and hover effects that create a cohesive and soothing user experience.

Getting Started
AI Features
The application integrates Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash API to provide intelligent, personalized support. Users receive mood-based guidance with personalized wellness tips tailored to their selected emotional state. The AI analyzes journal entries and generates reflections and insights to help users understand their emotional patterns. All responses are contextually aware and tailored to both the user's emotional state and the content they have written. The API is loaded dynamically and does not require any manual setup or configuration.

Data Storage
All journal entries are stored securely on your local device using your browser's local storage, ensuring your personal data remains private and under your control. The application does not send your entries to external servers, with the exception of AI requests sent to Google's Gemini API for generating insights.

Privacy & Security
All journal entries are stored exclusively on your local device using the browser's local storage, ensuring your personal data remains private and under your control. The application does not send your entries to external servers, with the exception of AI requests sent to Google's Gemini API for generating insights. All user input is properly escaped and sanitized to prevent XSS attacks and other security vulnerabilities. The application implements no analytics or tracking features, so your usage patterns and data are not monitored or collected.

Browser Compatibility
The application is fully compatible with modern browsers including Chrome and Edge version 90 or higher, Firefox version 88 or higher, and Safari version 14 or higher. The responsive design also ensures full functionality on mobile browsers including iOS Safari and Chrome for Android, allowing users to access Serenus on their smartphones and tablets.

Future Enhancements
We have several exciting features planned to further improve Serenus and provide a more comprehensive mental wellness experience. User authentication and profiles will allow individuals to access their journals and mood history across multiple devices. Cloud backup functionality will ensure that users' valuable journal entries are safely preserved and can be restored if needed. A dark mode toggle will provide an alternative visual theme for users who prefer it or need it for accessibility reasons. Custom mood categories will enable users to define emotions beyond the default four options, allowing for more personalized emotional tracking. Export functionality will allow users to download their journal entries as PDF files for personal records or to share with healthcare providers. Social features may include optional sharing of insights or entries with trusted friends or support groups. A native mobile app version is being considered to provide a more seamless experience on smartphones and tablets. Multiple language support will make Serenus accessible to users worldwide, breaking down language barriers to mental wellness. Integration with meditation and mindfulness timers will enhance the breathing and relaxation features. Finally, weekly mood trends and analytics will help users understand their emotional patterns over time and identify areas for improvement.
