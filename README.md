# Serenus - Mental Wellness Web Application

Serenus is a serene, interactive mental wellness application designed to help users manage their emotional health through journaling, mood tracking, and guided breathing exercises. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a beautiful sakura-themed interface and AI-powered insights using Google's Gemini API.

## Features

### Home Page
The home page features a mood dial where users can select from four emotional states: Happy, Calm, Sad, and Anxious. Based on the selected mood, the application provides AI-powered guidance with personalized insights and coping strategies tailored to the user's emotional state. The interface includes soothing visual effects through particle animations and offers optional calming background music to enhance the experience. The design is fully responsive and works seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices.

### Journal Page
The journal page provides a beautiful, distraction-free writing interface for users to document their thoughts and feelings. Each entry can be tagged with the user's emotional state through mood tracking, and all entries are automatically dated and timestamped for easy reference. Users can browse their past entries in a timeline view displayed in reverse chronological order. The application generates AI-generated reflections and guidance based on the journal content, providing personalized insights into the user's emotional patterns. Users have the ability to delete entries with confirmation, and all entries are saved securely in the browser's local storage.

### Breathe Page
The breathe page offers an interactive breathing exercise with visual cues to guide users through proper breathing techniques. Users can customize the timing of each breath to their comfort level, and the interface features an animated circle that expands and contracts in synchronization with the recommended breathing pattern.

### Design & Aesthetics
The application uses a serene Japanese cherry blossom aesthetic with a sakura video background throughout. The color scheme features soft, calming rose and pink tones that create a soothing atmosphere. The interface includes calm background music to enhance relaxation, and all interactions feature smooth animations with elegant transitions and hover effects that create a cohesive and soothing user experience.

## Getting Started

## AI Features

The application integrates Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash API to provide intelligent, personalized support. Users receive mood-based guidance with personalized wellness tips tailored to their selected emotional state. The AI analyzes journal entries and generates reflections and insights to help users understand their emotional patterns. All responses are contextually aware and tailored to both the user's emotional state and the content they have written. The API is loaded dynamically and does not require any manual setup or configuration.

## Data Storage

All journal entries are stored securely on your local device using your browser's local storage, ensuring your personal data remains private and under your control. The application does not send your entries to external servers, with the exception of AI requests sent to Google's Gemini API for generating insights.

## Privacy & Security

All journal entries are stored exclusively on your local device using the browser's local storage, ensuring your personal data remains private and under your control. The application does not send your entries to external servers, with the exception of AI requests sent to Google's Gemini API for generating insights. All user input is properly escaped and sanitized to prevent XSS attacks and other security vulnerabilities. The application implements no analytics or tracking features, so your usage patterns and data are not monitored or collected.

## Browser Compatibility

The application is fully compatible with modern browsers including Chrome and Edge version 90 or higher, Firefox version 88 or higher, and Safari version 14 or higher. The responsive design also ensures full functionality on mobile browsers including iOS Safari and Chrome for Android, allowing users to access Serenus on their smartphones and tablets.
